My name is Oscar Montoya. I'm a senior software engineering student at
CETYS. I have huge interests in system design, web development and data
analysis. I'm currently learning Bash scripting along with Scikit-Learn. My favorite
music genre is rock.

I like reading, watching movies and playing board games
in my spare time. Especially [Catan](https://www.catan.com/) and
[Unstable Unicorns](https://www.unstablegames.com/collections/unstable-unicorns).
